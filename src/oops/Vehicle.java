//inheritance
//Multiple Inheritance results in a number of complexities. Java does not support Multiple Inheritance.
//super class reference variable can hold an object of sub class
//superclass variable cannot call methods of subclass even if it holds the object of sub class. we need to use casting to perform this operation.

//same method name but different method input parameter
//overloading can happen in same class or sub class

//super class reference variable can hold an object of sub class

//same method name

//input parameter can be of sub class
//return type can be of subclass
//exception can be of subclass
// Cannot throw bigger exceptions than Super Class
// Cannot reduce visibility of SuperClass Method
