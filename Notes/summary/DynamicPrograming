enumeration - climb stair problem, how many different ways we can climb stairs

**Fibonacci Numbers
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13 [element at nth location] [0 is at 0th position]

**There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of ways, the person can reach the top.
solution of this puzzel and Fibonacci is same


*** Given a rod of length n inches and an array of prices that contains prices of all pieces of size smaller than n.
Determine the maximum value obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces

minimization/maximization - stock sold on same or different rate, calculate maximum profit
yes/no question - can you form x pennies and z quaters.




    //Given an array, find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum.
    //Runtime Complexity
    //Linear, O(n).
    //Memory Complexity
    //Constant, O(1).

    //Imagine a game (like baseball) where a player can score 1, 2 or 4 runs. Given a score "n", find the total number of ways score "n" can be reached.
    //Runtime Complexity
    //Linear, O(n).
    //Memory Complexity
    //Linear, O(n).



    //Given coin denominations and the total amount, find out the numberâ€‹ of ways to make the change.
    //we have coin denominations 1, 2 and 5 and the total amount is 7.
    //Runtime Complexity
    //O(m n) where m is number of denominations and n is amount.
    //Memory Complexity
    //Linear, O(n) where n is the amount.


   //minimum coin change




   //Given two strings, compute the Levenshtein distance between them i.e. the minimum number of edits required to convert one string into the other.
