Binary Search [Recursive] -

Runtime Complexity
Logarithmic, O(logn).

Memory Complexity
Logarithmic, O(logn).
Recursive solution has O(logn) memory complexity as it will consume memory on the stack.


Binary Search [Iterative] -

Runtime Complexity
Logarithmic, O(logn).

Memory Complexity
Constant, O(1).

Iterative solution has same O(logn) runtime complexity as the recursive solution but has better memory complexity.

mid = min + ((max-min)/2);


interpolationSearch is modified version of Binary Search , it;s good if data set is evenly distributed, its not skewed,

mid = min + ((max - min)/(data[max] - data[min]))*(input-data[min]);


QuickSelect - kth smallest/largest element.

heap - top 5 element or 5 smallest element
