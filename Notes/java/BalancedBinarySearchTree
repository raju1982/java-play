BALANCED BINARY SEARCH TREE
INSERTION	FOR A BALANCED BST THE WORST CASE IS- COMPLEXITY O(LG N)
ACCESS 		ACCESSING THE HIGHEST PRIORITY ELEMENT IS AGAIN O(LG N)
REMOVE		REMOVING THE HIGHEST PRIORITY ELEMENT IS O(LG N)

An empty tree is height-balanced. A non-empty binary tree T is balanced if:
1) Left subtree of T is balanced
2) Right subtree of T is balanced
3) The difference between heights of left subtree and right subtree is not more than 1.

Convert a normal BST to Balanced BST
in-line depth search gives sorted element list (arraylist)
recursion - list, min, max
