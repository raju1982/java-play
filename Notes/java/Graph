A GRAPH IS A SET OF VERTICES/Node AND EDGES (V, E)
UNDIRECTED EDGES REPRESENT 2-WAY RELATIONSHIPS                      [I AM HIS FRIEND AND HE IS MINE]
DIRECTED EDGES REPRESENT 1-WAY RELATIONSHIPS  (ARROW ON THE EDGE)   [I REPORT TO MY MANAGER]

F IS SAID TO HAVE A DEGREE OF 3             [3 EDGES ARE INCIDENT ON VERTEX F]
THIS SERIES OF EDGES IS CALLED A PATH

A CONNECTED GRAPH WITH NO CYCLES IS A TREE

THERE ARE 3 STANDARD WAYS THAT GRAPHS CAN BE REPRESENTED
ADJACENCY MATRIX
ADJACENCY LIST
ADJACENCY SET

INDEGREE NUMBER OF INWARD DIRECTED GRAPH EDGES FOR A GIVEN GRAPH VERTEX
IF THERE WERE NO VERTICES WITH 0 INDEGREE, THEN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO TOPOLOGICAL SORT

THE GRAPH HAS A CYCLE!

TOPOLOGICAL SORT -> start with VERTICES with zero INDEGREE, then remove it and reduce neighbor INDEGREE by 1.

IT IS AN ORDERING OF VERTICES IN A DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPH IN WHICH EACH NODE COMES BEFORE ALL THE NODES TO WHICH IT HAS OUTGOING EDGES
