search engine store results in hash -

hash Table has an array of linked list.
each array element is a linked list containing search result of a single topic.
array index is decided using hashing algorithm. [key%arrayl.length]
each element has key, data and next element pointer.
key is unique to an element with in link list.

hash -> key.hashCode() % INITIAL_SIZE;

search -
0(n)  = hash the element + 0(1) [array] + 0(n) [link list]

add -
0(n)  = hash the element + 0(1) [array] + 0(n) [link list]

delete -
0(n)  = hash the element + 0(1) [array] + 0(n) [link list]
